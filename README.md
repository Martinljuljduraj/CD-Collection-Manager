The program allows you to create CD objects containing album information, store CDs inside a dynamically resizing collection, display the full collection with total cost, remove the most recently added CD, and interact with the collection through a menu‑driven console interface

Full Breakroom of Class:

1. `CD.java`
Represents a single CD with a Title, Artist, Track number and Cost
Includes getters, setters, and a formatted toString() method.

2. `CDCollection.java`
Manages an array of CD objects. Features include adding CDs, automatically resizing the array when full, removing the last CD added, tracking the total cost of the collection, and printing the entire collection in a readable format.

3. `DriverCD.java`
This creates a CD collection that adds sample CDs, prints the collection, allows the user to remove CDs or view the total cost, and finally, loops until the user chooses to exit.
